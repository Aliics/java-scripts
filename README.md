# java-scripts

Just some script in `Java` that I need to use pretty often.
These are hacky, quick, and not made with "best practice".

AKA these are just shitty little scripts I put together, but I need them.

Use them if you'd like. ðŸ¤·

# build

No build tool was used to create any scripts because nothing like dependency management, tests, or
sensible packing was needed. These are just tiny little code blocks that are occasionally useful.

Use the `build-script` bash script to build and install jar from the corresponding directory.

*Example:*

To build the `day-start` script, do the following:
> ./build-script day-start DayStart

The first parameter is the directory and script name. The second parameter is the java class.
